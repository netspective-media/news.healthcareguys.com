The next telecommunication revolution is just around the corner: the promises of high bandwidth, low latency and low-power-low-cost of 5G will open the gate to a flood of new inventions and the implementation of ideas, which are already long in the public consciousness – such as stable augmented reality or truly immersive virtual reality platforms powered by networks. 5G in healthcare will finally allow the building of infrastructure suitable for the interplay of health sensors, algorithms, and smart devices, for the smooth operation of telemedicine, or even for providing a way for parents to interact with babies who are stuck in incubators.
