Virtual care can connect the nurses office with the doctors office, boosting attendance and cutting costs across the healthcare ecosystem. Hazel Health, a San Francisco-based healthcare company, aims to expand care access to every child in the country, regardless of insurance, immigration status or family income. The company is pursuing this goal by bringing telehealth into schools, connecting children to doctors at no cost to their families. It already serves more than 10,000 students in 11 school districts and has a track record of more than 8,000 telehealth visits.
