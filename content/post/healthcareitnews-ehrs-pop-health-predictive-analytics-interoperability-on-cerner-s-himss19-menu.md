With HIMSS19 just days away, EHR giant Cerner has a lot on its mind. And its executives at the global health IT conclave are going to be focused on a variety of trends affecting EHRs and much more.

“Healthcare is a fast-paced industry defined by dramatic shifts in regulations, technology, care delivery and patient-physician interactions,” said John Peterzalek, chief client officer at Cerner. “At HIMSS19, we’re showcasing how our solutions integrate and help solve challenges and identify opportunities not only for today, but for the future.”

To that end, Cerner will be discussing trends including population health, seamless care and others, with an eye how those trends will transform the industry into the future.

“At HIMSS19, we’ll highlight the shifts from retrospective analytics to predictive analytics, a health system chart to a longitudinal record and plan, and population health to personalized health,” Peterzalek commented. “We also will focus on the future of healthcare through partnerships, improving national and local public healthcare, and continuing our mission to provide seamless care across the globe.”

The complexity required to move patients through a health system exceed those of any other industry – and the stakes are very high, Peterzalek remarked.

“Providers today are tasked with the challenge of managing the supply and demand equation, having to assess patients’ needs with available resources and staff without real-time or predictive capabilities to assist,” he said. “In order to perform and plan with excellence, healthcare organizations should embed real-time and predictive capabilities into operationally aware clinical workflows, which deliver action back into these workflows.”
