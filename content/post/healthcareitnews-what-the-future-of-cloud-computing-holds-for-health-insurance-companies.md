With the increasing importance of analytics and data management, a cloud-first mentality is ideally suited for health insurers, who are using the technology to streamline operations, reduce costs, and better interact with their customers.

At the same time, the move toward value-based care means claims-based data and analytics can provide a comprehensive view of an insurerâ€™s transactions by aggregating claims across healthcare plans.
