From early in my career to my current role as a consultant, I’ve seen both the reasons why all of us in the industry should continue to push for standards-based interoperability and how champions of the cause are able to educate others on its importance and encourage them to take action.

As healthcare IT professionals, we are the lucky few who, while being subjected to the cumbersome and burdensome processes that every patient experiences, know in the back of our minds why we are being asked for the same information repeatedly. But hearing a frustrated family member ask, “Why don’t all my doctors have my (fill in the blank test result)?” is difficult.

We know that a comprehensive, integrated approach to care isn’t unrealistic. However, we continue to put people through these frustrating processes when we have the technology to make it better.

Sadly, we also know the answer: change takes time, initiative, effort, persistence and money. None of that is simple, common, or in unlimited supply. Therefore, it is incumbent upon those of us who are the lucky few to understand all of this to embrace the challenge of change. We all have a responsibility to continuously educate and advocate for the exchange of data that utilizes interoperability standards and frameworks.
