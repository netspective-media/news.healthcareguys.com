Artificial intelligence (AI) is finding its way into many areas of healthcare, now including mobile devices, thanks to an application designed by the Georgia Institute of Technology to guide and support cancer patients.

The mobile app, which runs on a tablet computer, gives 50 breast cancer patients in rural Georgia personalized recommendations on everything from side effects to insurance, and the information regularly changes based on each patientâ€™s progress.
