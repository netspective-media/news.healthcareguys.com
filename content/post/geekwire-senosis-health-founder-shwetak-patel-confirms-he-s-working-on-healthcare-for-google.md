title: Senosis Health founder Shwetak Patel confirms he’s working on healthcare for
  Google
---
It has been nearly two years since Google quietly acquired Senosis Health, a Seattle startup that figured out how to turn ordinary smartphones into monitoring devices to detect pulmonary function, hemoglobin counts and other health information.

The deal wasn’t publicly announced by the companies at the time. GeekWire later obtained documents through a public records request confirming the deal and showing that Google’s Nest division actually made the acquisition. Senosis was formed at the University of Washington in Seattle.

But in a recent interview, Senosis co-founder Shwetak Patel acknowledged that he’s working on healthcare for Google following the acquisition and hinted that there’s more news to come.

“I’m pretty excited to be working within Google under Dave Feinberg’s leadership, to be able to have an impact in healthcare,” Patel told GeekWire last week. “Unfortunately, that’s all I can say for now, but there will be things in the future that become more obvious what’s going on.”
