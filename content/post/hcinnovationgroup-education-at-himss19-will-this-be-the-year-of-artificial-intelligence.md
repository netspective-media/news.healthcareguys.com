Just a cursory glance at this year’s educational schedule at the HIMSS Conference, which is being held this week at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, makes it clear: artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning will be major subjects for discussion at HIMSS19.

Just a few examples: Session MLAI03, “Keynote: Synergies Between Man and Machine”; Session MLAI04, “State of the Industry: Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare”; Session PTS07, “Smarter Care: The AI-Driven Patient Experience”; Session MLAI06, “AI and Imaging: Your Data as a Strategic Asset”; Session MLAI11, “How AI Enabled a Community Hospital to Tackle Clinical Variation and Reduce Length-of-Stay”; Session MLAI07, “Blockchain & AI: Stronger Together”; Session MLAI19, “Integrating an End-to-End AI Solution into Clinical Workflow”; Session MLAI15, “Using AI and NLP to Alleviate Physician Burnout”; Session RCSS16, “AI, Workforce Development, and Other Key Takeaways”; Session PH01, “Artificial Intelligence & Telemedicine”; Session ISED01, “Artificial Intelligence—A Solution for Interoperability?”; Session IL42, “AI + Neurotechnology Attacking Chronic Pain Crisis”; Session 22, “Ethics of AI in Healthcare: Developing the Right Framework for Innovative Clinical Delivery”; Session IL07, “The Role of AI in the (Near) Future of Healthcare”; Session IL09, “Streamline Analytics with AI & Machine Learning”; Session 54, “Artificial Intelligence vs. COPD: The Fight for Patient Health”; Session LS12, “Using AI to Manage Clinical Variation”; Session PH13, “Patient Journey Digitalization Using IT and AI”; and Session IH54, “Predictive Clinical Surveillance with AI.”
