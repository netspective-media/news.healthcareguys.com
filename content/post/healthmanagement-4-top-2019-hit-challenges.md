While healthcare IT that supports telehealth and remote monitoring are gaining ground, other technology is hardly emerging from the pilot stage in addition to competing for a slice of the budget .

 

One of the top consumers of the HIT budget is the EHR which, in spite of having a reputation for poor user-friendliness is still the default choice for health systems aiming to encourage patient engagement.

 

Where healthcare CIOs are likely to face friction is in a trade-off between traditional EHR systems, with relative ease of deployment and integration and new digital health technologies with superior design advanced analytical capabilities.

 

Generally, digital health initiatives will deliver low ROIs until they gain enterprise-wide traction.

Still, as machine learning and natural language processing algorithms steadily improve and the choice of technology analytics solutions for healthcare grow, the prospects for AI in 2019 look good.
