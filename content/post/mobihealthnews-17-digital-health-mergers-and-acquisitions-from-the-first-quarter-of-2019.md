title: 17 digital health mergers and acquisitions from the first quarter of 2019
---
The first quarter of 2019 started off strong with 17 digital health mergers and acquisitions, including five over the course of two days at the end of February. The quarter's acquisitions included moves by ClassPass and Teladoc to bolster emerging international businesses with the acquisitions of GuavaPass and Médecin Direct, respectively, as well as a number of consolidation deals in niche digital health markets, such as AbleTo's acquisition of Joyable. Still others represented novel synergies between similar but distinct companies, like Crossover Health's purchase of Sherpaa. Finally, we saw another major private equity deal as Qualcomm divested itself of its Qualcomm Life business.

Read on for 17 digital health mergers and acquisitions from Q1 2019. And let us know if we missed one — we'll update this article. As usual, they're ordered first by price tag, with the undisclosed deals sorted chronologically.

BioTelemetry acquires Geneva Healthcare for $65 million

Remote patient monitoring company BioTelemetry announced in January plans to acquire startup Geneva Healthcare, maker of remote monitoring for implantable cardiac devices, for $45 million in upfront cash with additional performance-based earn-out considerations of no less than $20 million. 

Biotelemetry will gain access to Geneva’s cloud-based platform, which has the ability to aggregate data from device manufacturer systems. This gives physicians a platform to remotely keep track all of their patients that have implantable cardiac devices such as pacemakers, defibrillators and loop recorders, while also providing the doctors with the results of routine checks and monitoring.
