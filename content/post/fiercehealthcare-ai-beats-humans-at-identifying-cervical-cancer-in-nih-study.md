title: AI beats humans at identifying cervical cancer in NIH study
---
Researchers at the National Cancer Institute developed an algorithm that can accurately identify precancerous changes in the cervixa potential boon to low-resource areas that don’t have enough medical professionals. In work published Thursday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, officials said the NCI team worked with a team from Global Gooda fund at Intellectual Venturesand “trained” their machine learning algorithm on complex visual inputs, such as medical images. Ultimately, they said, they got the machine to accurately identify patterns of cervical cancer.They verified the computer’s findings with the National Library of Medicineanother branch of the National Institutes of Healthshowing the algorithm actually outperformed human experts reviewing the files.
