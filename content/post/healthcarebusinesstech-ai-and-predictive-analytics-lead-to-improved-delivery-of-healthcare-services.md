Despite healthcare professionals purest intentions and dogged efforts to heal their patients, theyre limited by being human. They have only so much time and energy available for finding, processing and remembering information related to the medical conditions they manage, not to mention correlating that vast trove of information with their patients personal medical histories. Thats where artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive analytics come in.
