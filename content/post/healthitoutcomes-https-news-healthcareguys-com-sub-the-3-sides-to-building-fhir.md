The FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) standard has reached a key milestone with release 4. The standard itself, and vendor support, have attained a plateau of maturity, and the industry is anticipating its potential benefits. Now, an important question lingers will this revision of FHIR bring the ecosystem closer to a single standard of interoperability?Originally sponsored by Health Level Seven International (HL7) in 2011, FHIR presents a common framework and the best hope yet to resolve differences among disparate players in healthcare data exchange. The current state of FHIR adoption outside of EHR vendor APIs is still nascent, and implementation inconsistencies among EHR vendors to-date have been frustrating. As a result, 2019 and beyond may be nowhere close to what many are expecting.In order to realize the full value of FHIR, there must be collaboration between EHR vendors, provider organizations and application (app) vendors. Lets examine steps that each of these stakeholders should be taking to keep the FHIR momentum alive.
