HIMSS TV on Monday announced that two more speakers will be interviewed at the Global Conference next week: Ben Moscovitch and Beth Landon. Moscovitch is project director of health information technology at Pew Charitable Trusts and Landon is the Director of Policy at New Mexico Hospital Association.

Late last week, HIMSS TV said Dr. Stanley Shaw and Dr. John Halamka will be interviewed on site. Shaw is associate dean of executive education at Harvard Medical School and Halamka is CIO at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Professor of International Healthcare at Harvard Medical School. Among other topics, the two will discuss the upcoming Data, Insights, & Strategies for the Health Enterprise event at Harvard in June.

HIMSS TV previously noted that Aashima Gupta and John Kansky will appear on the video channel.
