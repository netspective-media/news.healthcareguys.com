HIMSS TV, the video arm of HIMSS Media, launched last year at HIMSS18 — and now we’re coming back for HIMSS19 in Orlando next month.

First things first: This year, HIMSS TV will be hosted by Kate Milliken, an entrepreneur and patient advocate with some serious health IT chops of her own.

Kate will be hosting a range of guests from health system executives to startup CEOs, health IT pros at academic medical centers, the people driving hospital innovation -- not to mention HIMSS19 Social Media Ambassadors and Champions of Health as well as many Subject Matter Experts. Scroll down to the end of this story for a video introduction to our host.

HIMSS TV has announced a number of speakers who have joined its lineup of health IT experts who will be interviewed on-site during HIMSS19 in Orlando next month.

Specifically, former four-term Vermont Gov. Jim Douglas, who is a long-time health IT proponent and the co-Chair of HIMSS State Advisory Roundtable will appear on HIMSSTV, as will Cynthia Green-Edwards, who is chief compliance officer for Michigan’s Department of Health and Human Services and the 2018 HIMSS State Official of the Year.

Plenty more folks will be featured on the show: Aashima Gupta, director of global healthcare solutions at Google Cloud, will be one of a number of speakers talking about the landscape of opportunities and challenges women in the health IT world, as will Lygeia Ricciardi, chief transformation officer at Carium Technology Solutions and former director of consumer e-Health at ONC. Hospital innovation superstars Dr. John Halamka (Harvard Medical), Dr. Richard Milani (Ochsner Health System), and Dr. Ashish Atreja (Mount Sinai Health System) will all sit down to share insights and experiences.
