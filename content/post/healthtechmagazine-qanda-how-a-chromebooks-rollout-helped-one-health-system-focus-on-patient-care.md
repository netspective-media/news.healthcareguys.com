title: 'Q&A: How a Chromebooks Rollout Helped One Health System Focus on Patient Care'
---
Simplicity and cost savings made this device deployment an immediate success for paramedics, says Middlesex Health Desktop Architect Michael Romatzick. Is it possible to launch a new device that cuts costs, simplifies workflow and requires no formal training from staff? At Connecticut-based Middlesex Health, the IT team already has. In an effort to replace the clunky, state-issued computers its paramedics and staff were using, the organization turned to ruggedized Chromebooks originally built for the education sector, and with the changeover immediately saw improvements in budget and workflow.

How can healthcare organizations replicate this success? HealthTech spoke with Michael Romatzick, desktop architect at Middlesex Health, on the lessons the IT staff learned from the organizationâ€™s Chromebook deployment.
