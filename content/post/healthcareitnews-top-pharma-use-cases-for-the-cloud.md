title: Top pharma use cases for the cloud

From designing commercial trials to track-and-trace management, cloud computing offers several compelling use cases for pharmaceutical companies.

Applications delivered in the cloud and paid for as a subscription are enabling businesses to enjoy the benefits of enterprise solutions, without having to dedicate specific resources or significant cash flow to a single tool.

“The industry is definitely on the growth side of cloud computing services,” said Ponemon Institute founder Larry Ponemon.

IDC research manager for life sciences commercial strategies Mike Townsend added that “what’s great about cloud is the cost of entry is much lower, because they’re subscribing to software, and in some cases storage applications that can scale very easily — there aren’t a lot of upfront costs.”
