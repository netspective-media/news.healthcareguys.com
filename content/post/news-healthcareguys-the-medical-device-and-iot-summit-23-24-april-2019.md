SUMMIT CHAIRPERSON Tim Gee, Principal, Medical Connectivity Consulting CHAIRPERSONS NOTE Since the advent of the HITECH Act in 2009, EMRs have gone from a growth to a replacement market. Connecting medical devices to EMRs for clinical documentation has also gone from a growth to replacement market. In this new environment, the connectivity focus has shifted from clinical documentation of medical device data into the patients chart, to capturing and consuming device data in a myriad of ways.
