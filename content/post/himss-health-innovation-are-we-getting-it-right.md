During his career, Steve Wretling, chief technology and innovation officer for HIMSS, has supported the development of numerous innovative projects, including the planning, strategizing and deployment of a telehealth technology platform.

“What really stood out to me in the process was understanding the details of how to provide a virtual visit that resulted in a meaningful patient and provider experience,” Wretling shared. “I found that the technology was completely secondary. In fact, it almost needed to be invisible in that development process in order to get to the point of effectively deploying that innovation.”

Although technology is often touted as the spearhead, Wretling is more focused on the bigger picture at play. "The reality is, ideas can come from the technology side, but the real sauce comes from truly understanding the experience you’ll be providing, the process and how it impacts the patient.”
