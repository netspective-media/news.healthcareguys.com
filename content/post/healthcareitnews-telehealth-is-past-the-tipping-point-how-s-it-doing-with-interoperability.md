title: Telehealth is past the 'tipping point' – how's it doing with interoperability?
---
A new survey from the American Telemedicine Association assesses the current state of data exchange standards for remote care and offers best practices for health systems looking to capitalize on its potential. As the American Telemedicine Association annual conference kicks off in New Orleans this week, the organization has published a white paper focused on the status of telehealth interoperability.

WHY IT MATTERS
The opportunities and challenges for healthcare stakeholders include standards, governance and workflows as telehealth, which "has passed the tipping point of market momentum," gains traction nationwide, according to the ATA’s report Telehealth Interoperability: Driving Choice, Continuity, and Scale.

The promise is immense, but big hurdles still remain before it reaches its full potential.

"In many cases, telehealth clinical services and settings are fragmented and data is siloed, with low-volume telehealth services such as those for specific locations or clinical specialties standing alone rather than being designed as part of a larger, integrated system," according to the ATA.

"As these fragmented systems proliferate, they result in costly, redundant software infrastructure and endpoints that limit the potential to improve overall quality and access to care," researchers wrote. "These fragmented systems also make it difficult for payers (government agencies, private insurers, and employers) to gain access to the comprehensive member data needed for claims and utilization management systems, and add to the challenges of performance tracking, reimbursement, and incentives."
