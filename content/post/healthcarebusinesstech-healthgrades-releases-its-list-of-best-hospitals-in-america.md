title: Healthgrades releases its list of best hospitals in America
---
Another big name in hospital rankings has just put out its annual list of top-performing hospitals in the U.S. Healthgrades released three different rankings for 2019: America’s 50 Best Hospitals, America’s 100 Best Hospitals and America’s 250 Best Hospitals. 

These hospitals are part of the top 1%, 2% and 5% of facilities in the nation, according to the Healthgrades’ America’s Best Hospitals’ website. Healthgrades bases its rankings on quality data contained in millions of Medicare claims records from close to 4,500 hospitals.

Healthgrades rates hospital quality exclusively based on clinical outcomes for 32 of the most common conditions and procedures found in hospitals, which sets it apart from other organizations that measure quality of care. It also measures hospital performance over multiple years, instead of just one year.

America’s 50 Best Hospitals, or the top 1% of performers, earn this distinction by providing excellent care to patients for a variety of conditions and surgeries consistently for many consecutive years. With America’s 100 Best Hospitals, or the top 2% of facilities, hospitals must meet these standards for a few years in a row. America’s 250 Best Hospitals, or the top 5% of performers, provided top-quality care during the current year.
