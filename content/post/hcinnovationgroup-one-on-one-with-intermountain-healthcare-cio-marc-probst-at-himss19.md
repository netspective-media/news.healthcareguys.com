title: One-on-One with Intermountain Healthcare CIO Marc Probst at HIMSS19
---
Marc Probst has been the CIO of the Salt Lake City, Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare since 2003, and in that time he has been to his fair share of HIMSS conferences, investigating new technologies while also taking sharp notice of how the health IT policy landscape has changed over the years.

This year at HIMSS19 in Orlando, proposed regulations from CMS (the Centers of Medicare & Medicaid Services) and ONC (Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT) have dominated the show discussion. In fact, each HIMSS conference seems to take more and more of a federal policy theme.

At the show this week, Probst, the CIO of the 23-hospital Intermountain Healthcare system, discussed the implications of these proposals, how much information blocking is actually occurring in the real world, while also remarking on the new innovations that are catching his eye. Below are excerpts of the discussion between Probst and Healthcare Innovation.
