title: 'Venrock: AI finding its place, blockchain may never matter'

“AI is slowly finding its place, while blockchain struggles as much in healthcare as in other segments,” Venrock noted. “At the typical pace innovation matures in healthcare, blockchain may never matter, but there is great confidence that AI will get there with only 1 percent pessimism.”

That’s not to suggest AI is overwhelmingly being embraced today. Instead, 53 percent are still waiting for it to make a difference, but 39 percent said it is marginally making a different and only 7 percent have found it meaningful.

When it comes to blockchain, however, 75 percent are still struggling to find its role in healthcare, the firm found, whereas 18 percent have found ways blockchain can be used to benefit patients. The last 7 percent is still asking what, exactly, blockchain is.
