As cybersecurity threats in the healthcare sector evolve, medical device manufacturer ICU Medical is taking a number of steps to help safeguard its products. Marshall Fryman and Chaitanya Srinivasamurthy of the company describe these security initiatives.

Among the steps the San Clemente, California-based company is taking is enhancing single sign-on capabilities through a recent partnership with identity and authentication vendor Imprivata, Fryman says.

The enhanced single sign-on minimizes the burden on clinical users to obtain secure access to ICU Medical's devices, he says in an interview with Information Security Media Group.

"The key aspect of security of any system is security in layers, or in depth. So our products focus a lot on that approach," he says.

"We build a very deep layer of security around our products and our interoperability. Unfortunately, it's a hostile world, and you continuously see attempts to attack devices and networks both in medical and commercial spaces. It's a never-ending game of staying one leap ahead of where the attacks are coming from."
