title: 10 Reasons Why Digital Health Start-Ups Go Bust - The Medical Futurist

We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care. As currently there’s an app for everything, you thought you make one that estimates the time needed to deliver food – so anyone could order pad thai from the closest place possible. Every single entrepreneur knows that a good idea is as a tiny part in the success of the company as one single brick in the Great Wall of China. Funding, product development, a viable business model with an appropriate marketing strategy, finding and keeping the right people, being able to scale and personally grow up to the tasks and challenges. Now, that pizza delivery estimate app doesn’t sound that good, does it?
