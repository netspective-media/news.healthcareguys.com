But a main point of focus for the panel centered instead on what didn’t happen.From obsolete technologies still in favor to long-held goals still out of reach for the industry, many of the health innovations expected in 2018 didn’t happen, speakers said during a panel held by Politico and CVS Health. The speakers speculated that some of these changes might arrive in 2019but only if the right regulatory conditions arise.
