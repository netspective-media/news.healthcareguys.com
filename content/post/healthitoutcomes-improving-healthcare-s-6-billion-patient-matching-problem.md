title: Improving Healthcare’s 6 Billion Patient Matching Problem
---
If duplicate medical records were a disease, it would be a pandemic. The problem not only endangers patient safety and an organization’s reputation but contributes to needless waste and inefficiencies while jeopardizing value-based reimbursements. The financial impact is substantial—duplicate records cost the average hospital $1.5 million and the U.S. healthcare system over $6 billion dollars annually.
