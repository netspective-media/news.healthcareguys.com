title: What Younger Generations Demand from Health IT
---
The times are changing, and how people expect to consume healthcare is following suit. This is according to a recent survey from Accenture, which found that younger generations, including millennials (the cohort born after 1985) and Generation Z (those born after 1995) are more likely to turn to new care models, such as virtual visits and retail clinics, in lieu of traditional care models.

This is likely because younger generations expect a different standard. According to the survey, these generations, in particular, were more likely to express dissatisfaction with current healthcare delivery models and less likely to embrace traditional care factors, such as primary care physicians. While 84 percent of baby boomers reported having a PCP, only 55 percent of those in Generation Z said they had one, noting that PCPs didnâ€™t meet their budgetary or convenience needs.

Changes like this are likely to push new care models forward, especially those that embrace technology, as demographics shift. In fact, according to Bloomberg, millennials and Generation Z combined currently represent more than 60 percent of the population.
