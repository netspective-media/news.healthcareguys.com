title: Where Is Digital Health Heading In Denmark? - The Medical Futurist
---
After reading the Danish digital health strategy, one of the most forward-looking examples of a government-supported objective to adjust the medical arena to the 21st century, we looked around what real-life projects aim to transform patients’ and doctors’ lives for the better in the Scandinavian country. Our findings are thrilling: the newly established Danish National Genome Center strives to have at least 60,000 whole-genome sequenced in the next 5 years, while the Copenhagen Healthtech Cluster wants to set up a network of data registers updated so fast that it might enable helping doctors real-time – perhaps even in the OR.
