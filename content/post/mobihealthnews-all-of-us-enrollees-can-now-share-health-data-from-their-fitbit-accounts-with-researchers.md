  researchers

The National Institutes of Health made it clear from the start that Fitbits wearables would play a key role in the agencys ambitious All of Us Research Program.Now, eight months and more than 100,000 enrollees down the road, the agency and the device maker have announced that anyone who owns a Fitbit and has already enrolled in the program may consent to release the activity, heart rate, sleep and other health data stored in their Fitbit account with NIHs researchers.Collecting real-world, real-time data through digital technologies will become a fundamental part of the program, Eric Dishman, director of the All of Us Research Program, said in a statement. This information in combination with many other data types will give us an unprecedented ability to better understand the impact of lifestyle and environment on health outcomes and, ultimately, develop better strategies for keeping people healthy in a very precise, individualized way.Interested participants may begin syncing their data by visiting the Sync Apps & Devices page of the All of Us website. Users may use their Fitbit devices to directly sync their health data with the program, or manually input information such as weight or water intake into their Fitbit account and upload from there, according to a press release.
