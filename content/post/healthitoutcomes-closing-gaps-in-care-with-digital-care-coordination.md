title: Closing Gaps In Care With Digital Care Coordination
---
The rates for closing gaps in care are some of the most widely used, quantitative metrics to measure quality, allocate incentives, and control costs. Both health plans and providers are each financially incentivized to close gaps in care. For health plans, programs through Medicaid (HEDIS) and Medicare (STARS) have meaningful incentives andor penalties tied to a members ability to receive certain healthcare services. Similarly, valued-based providers can control costs by providing certain recurring services to their patients. Fee for service providers also benefit from the additional volume generated by closing gaps in care. Gap closure uniquely aligns quality and financial incentives across health plans and providers.
