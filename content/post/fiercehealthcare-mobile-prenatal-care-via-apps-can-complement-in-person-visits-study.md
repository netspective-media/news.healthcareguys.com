Mobile prenatal care visits can be just as effective as in-person provider visits, according to a recent study published in JMIR mHealth uHealth.

Using a mobile app, researchers at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences set out to see whether technology could take some of the cost and burden out of prenatal visits.

Previous studies have shown the number of in-person prenatal care visits can be reduced for low-risk patients by using a virtual care model, essentially saving patients and providers money. However, many of these studies also show a reduction in patient satisfaction equated with fewer visits.
