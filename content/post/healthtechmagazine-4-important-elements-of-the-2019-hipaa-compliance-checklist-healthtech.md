For healthcare organization IT teams tasked with keeping personal health information secure, there’s perhaps nothing more pressing than remaining compliant with security and privacy regulations. Chief among these are, of course, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the accompanying Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act.
