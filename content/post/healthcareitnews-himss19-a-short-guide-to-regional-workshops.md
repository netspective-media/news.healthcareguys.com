In a few days, healthcare IT stakeholders from more than 80 countries will meet in Orlando for the HIMSS19 global conference, where they will follow a packed agenda covering developments from a variety of regions, from South and Central America to Europe, Asia Pacific or Greater China.

Starting with the Middle East Summit on Monday, the regional workshop will see delegates focus on the training needed to upskill staff, based on a commitment in the region to invest in developing an "empowered and engaged eHealth workforce‚Äù. 

The beginning of the week will also see HIMSS, parent company of Healthcare IT News, take its CXO International Dialogue concept, initially launched in Singapore, global, which will tackle the impact of the democratisation of healthcare on the workforce. It will be hosted by HIMSS Chief Clinical Officer and Senior Advisor for Public Health England Dr Charles Alessi.
