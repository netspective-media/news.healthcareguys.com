title: 'HIMSS19: VA teams with Apple to bring Health Records feature to veterans'
---
The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has teamed up with Apple to make the Health Records on iPhone feature available to over 9 million veterans in the VA system by this summer.

In a Monday morning announcement dovetailing with the opening of the Healthcare Information and Management Sytems Society's (HIMSS) annual conference and exhibition, the VA said veterans will be able to access their personal medical data directly in the Health app on their iPhone, including health data across 1,243 VA facilities. Veterans also will be able to use the Health app to access their health data from hospitals and clinics outside the VA that are participating in the Apple Health Records project. Using the app, veterans will see an aggregated view of their allergies, conditions, immunizations, lab results, medications, procedures and vitals.

All Health Records data is encrypted and protected with the userâ€™s iPhone passcode, Touch ID or Face ID, according to Apple.
