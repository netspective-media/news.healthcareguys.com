title: Want health professionals to help reduce medical errors? Patient Safety Movement
  releases new curriâ€¦

Two decades ago, the Institute of Medicine shook the medical profession with its "To Err is Human" report which said nearly 100,000 people a year lost their lives to preventable medical errors.


With subsequent reports estimating that the number is likely much higher than that, more health systems have been seeking to find ways to engineer the possibility of human error out of their healthcare delivery.

During the 7th Annual World Patient Safety, Science & Technology Summit over the weekend, the Patient Safety Movement Foundation released a new tool on its website to help with the training.
