This article reviews the new book, Deep Medicine: How Artificial Intelligence Can Make Healthcare Human Again, by Eric Topol (2019). Topol is a cardiologist and a director at the Scripps Research Translational Institute in California. In his most recent work, Topol highlights how AI can create value by going beyond its current use cases of pattern recognition by incorporating humanistic elements. Topol argues that AI is about tools, whereas medicine is about interpersonal connections that AI can support.
