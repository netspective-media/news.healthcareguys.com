title: The Next Step To Value-Based Care Activating Healthcare Data For Physicians
---
Healthcare has seen a number of life-saving breakthroughs: vaccines, anesthesia, bypass surgery, the balloon catheter, and even decoding the human genome sequence. These have all changed the face of healthcare, transforming how we do things around here. But there’s one breakthrough which we have known is coming for a long time now.

That breakthrough is value-based care. Needless to say, making value-based care a reality is quite a challenge. The executives, leaders, regulators, and researchers have all pooled in their efforts to lead the transition to value-based care. But it’s the physicians who will make it happen- in their practices, in the exam rooms, in the emergency room, and at the patients’ bedside. So where are we going wrong? Why is the segment that influences a significant number of clinical decisions lagging behind in this transition?
