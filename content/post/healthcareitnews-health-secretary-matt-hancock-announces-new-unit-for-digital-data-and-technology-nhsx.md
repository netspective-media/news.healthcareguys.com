During Health and Social Care questions in the House of Commons yesterday, Hancock said: “NHSX will report jointly to the NHS and to me, and it will lead this vital [digital] agenda so that the NHS can be a world leader in emerging technologies that help to cut costs and save lives.”

NHSX will be responsible for setting national policy, developing and mandating standards for the use of technology in the health service, and revamping procurement through “streamlined spend control” and new frameworks supporting these standards, according to the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC).

“This new joint venture between the organisations who currently define digital strategy and commission digital services will create cohesion in these activities [digital transformation programme] by concentrating work and capabilities in one unit.
