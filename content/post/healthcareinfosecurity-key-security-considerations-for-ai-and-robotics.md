title: Key Security Considerations for AI and Robotics
---
As the use of artificial intelligence tools and robotics continues to grow, it's crucial for organizations to assess the potential security risks posed, says attorney Stephen Wu.

Among the growing applications of AI in the healthcare sector are tools to assist in the diagnosis of illnesses, the processing of medical images and the detection of fraud, Wu says in an interview with Information Security Media Group. Meanwhile, robotics use is expanding as well, especially for surgery.

"The HIPAA regulations don't talk about artificial intelligence and robotics in particular, so we have to use the general principles associated with HIPAA compliance and apply those to the particular systems being deployed," he explains.

For AI tools, Wu says, "you may have on-premises software - and we've been securing enterprise software for a long time on-premises. But a lot of these applications are being delivered as software as a service, so all the security controls we think about with cloud computing ... would apply to AI."
