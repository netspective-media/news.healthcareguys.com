title: Keeping protected health information private in the era of AI
---
New artificial intelligence-powered technology provides more convenient healthcare services for both healthcare organizations and their patients. A recent Accenture study reports that 20% of respondents have already used AI-based healthcare services. Its rise in popularity is no surprise, given that AI-powered technology gives healthcare organizations access to faster, better insights from the massive amount of data collected in electronic health systems.

This ease and convenience comes at a price – elevated potential for security breaches. How can healthcare leaders ensure the safety of protected health information (PHI) isn’t compromised in the rush toward the future of health care?
