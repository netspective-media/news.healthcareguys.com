ORLANDO – HIMSS CEO Hal Wolf of Tuesday outlined the most pressing challenges healthcare in America and other countries face today.

Those are an aging population, the chronic disease burden, geographic displacement, a lack of actionable information, challenged funding systems, increasingly demanding consumers and growing staff shortages.

“That demands we use digital health as a great equalizer that allows each person to have access to the best care they can,” Wolf said during the opening keynote and panel discussion. “The vision is to fill the health potential of every human everywhere. Simple, important and difficult.”

Wolf cut to the chase asking CMS Administrator Seema Verma about the HHS information-blocking proposed rule that arrived yesterday.
