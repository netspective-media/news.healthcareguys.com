Being a data-maniac, I created a health data system to document my vital signs and the progress towards the goals I set in areas of my life, which I want to improve. Here’s what I learned in 2018 and what you could get to know about yourself with the help of my Excel spreadsheet system about physical, mental and cognitive health.

My Excel Spreadsheet Method – A health data system for experimentation
There was no tracker, health sensor or wearable back in 1997 when I started to quantify my health to live to my fullest physical, emotional and mental capacity – for as long as possible, but at least beyond 100 years.

I started to collect data on a piece of paper – and as a starter, I advise you to do the same. (okay if that’s too old-school than in a spreadsheet). I gave a score from 1 to 10 to my mental, physical and emotional health, and I disciplined myself to follow through every day. Starting in 2016, an Excel spreadsheet took over the paper notes, and I’ve been refining the system step by step ever since – according to the technological changes (new fitness trackers such as my latest fitness pal) or my changing needs. For example, based on my system, I figured out that I need daily exercise to keep my mental health, so in 2017, I intensively exercised 27 minutes on average every single day. Last year, I had 25 minutes of intensive exercise on average per day, and I trained 150 hours altogether.

It might be beneficial to log your activity in one way or another to see your progress over time and get an idea what goals are realistic to achieve. Don’t worry, it only takes 2 minutes from your day to give a score to yourself from a scale from 1 to 5 in various areas if you already have the system, but reach out to me if you have trouble starting it or following through! But first, let’s see some data from 2018!
