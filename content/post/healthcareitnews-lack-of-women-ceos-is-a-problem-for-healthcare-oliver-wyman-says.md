title: Lack of women CEOs is a problem for healthcare, Oliver Wyman says
---
How can the industry really shift to patient-centric care and operations without executive input from the very people making the most decisions? More than 80 percent of the decisionmakers in the U.S. healthcare workforce are women and 65 percent of women in C-suite healthcare positions fill technical or influencer roles yet only 13 percent make it to CEO, according to the latest Oliver Wyman report. And, when they do make it to the top, it takes 3.5 years longer.The report, released Jan. 7, was based on a study of 3,000 healthcare C-suite executives and board members across the U.S and the career paths of 112 CEOs.
