title: How The Decentralized Web Will Drive Innovation In The Healthcare Industry
---
HIMSS is here once again and, as the industry gathers to explore the nexus of healthcare and technology, the one trend most will not be talking about is the decentralized web. But, mark my words, this movement and its underlying technologies are set to radically disrupt healthcare. Decentralized web technologies have the potential to reshape the way innovations are conceived and insights are discovered, to overhaul how providers deliver care and value, and to render data privacy concerns a thing of the past—all topics that feature in HIMSS’ own "2019 Healthcare Trends Forecast: The Beginning of a Consumer-Driven Reformation," report.
