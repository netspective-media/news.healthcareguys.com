The U.S. healthcare industry is looking less like a special case, a large segment of the U.S. economy with its own unique quirks, and is beginning to behave like other industries, according to “Top health industry issues of 2019: The New Health Economy comes of age,” the 13th annual healthcare report from consulting giant PwC.So for PwC Health Research Institute’s latest report, rather than focusing on issues only U.S. health organizations face, it for the first time is examining how healthcare is adapting to factors common to all industries: deals, business and tax strategy, risk and regulatory issues, workforce trends and digital transformation. The details may be specific to healthcare, but the business issues are shared with many other parts of the economy.The new report identifies six overarching issues facing healthcare in 2019:Digital therapeutics and connected care reshape the life sciences industryYour company’s new, upskilled health worker of the future is youTax reform has only just begun for healthcare companiesCreating the Southwest Airlines of healthcarePrivate equity healthcare’s new growth acceleratorThe Affordable Care Act in 2019 still alive
