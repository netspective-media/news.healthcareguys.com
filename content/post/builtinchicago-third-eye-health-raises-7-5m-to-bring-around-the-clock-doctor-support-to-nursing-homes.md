title: Third Eye Health raises $7.5M to bring around-the-clock doctor support to nursing
  homes
---
Nursing home patients may need care during hours when facility physicians are not present, but sending patients to the hospital can be a burdensome, financially taxing task for the patient, nursing home and the treatment center they arrive at.

Chicago-based Third Eye Health provides nurses with virtual, 24/7 physician-sourced professional guidance on how to treat patients in place rather than calling an ambulance — and it just raised a $7.25 million Series A to help it do so. 

“It’s validation of what we’ve been building,” said Ray George, VP of growth and strategy. “We’re really providing both clinical and financial value to our customers. So knowing that we’re having a really positive impact on patient lives and also on people’s business operations is very exciting for us.”

The company’s recent funding round was led by Generator Ventures and followed up by Cane Investment Partners, Ziegler Link-Age and Senior Care Development CEO David Reis, who will join Third Eye’s board of directors. Russell Hirsch and Katy Fike from Generator Ventures, and Amish Patel from Integrated Rehab Consultants will also join the company’s board.
