MANHASSET, N.Y., April 10, 2019 /PRNewswire/ -- The US Department of Health & Human Services Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) has awarded Thomas G. McGinn, MD, MPH, with a three-year, $1.14 million grant for a clinical decision support (CDS) system that reduces frontline providers' complications and frustrations. While clinical decision support has been widely available for years, healthcare providers have not adopted it widely because the systems are unwieldy and time-consuming for practitioners who are trying to access personalized clinical information and guidance in the real-time setting of patient encounters.
