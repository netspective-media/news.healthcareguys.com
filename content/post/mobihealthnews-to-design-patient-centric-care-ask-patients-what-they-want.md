title: To design patient-centric care, ask patients what they want

At Novant Health Physician Network in North Carolina, designing for the patient has been the hospital’s driving force for some years, especially when it comes to online interactions.

“We started back in 2010 or 2011 as we were rolling out our electronic health records,” Novant Health Physician Network chief operating officer Dr. Hank Capps told MobiHealthNews. “We made a philosophical decision to build the whole thing around how patients would experience it, which seems like a common sense thing, but back then records were being built around physicians and billing as the key drivers. Meaningful Use was at its peak. We went all in on creating experiences for patients inside and outside the four walls of the clinic. From there we did things early on like online appointments and opening up scheduling templates to make it more available to patients, to virtual visits, eVisits, or video visits.”
