title: What to know before putting healthcare claims data in the cloud

Cloud technology is fast becoming a tool used to help insurers store and analyze claims data as payers move to more nimble IT architectures.

Cloud-based storage of claims data will give payers the opportunity to strip away inefficiencies backed into legacy systems, where onerous manual processes can also lead to costly errors or lost information.

“If you’re relying on legacy systems, there is a strong likelihood of that data leaking off, or some type of data loss,” said Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute. “Claims data, to do it right, requires that you have a high capability for analytics and different tools available.”
