At HIMSS19, Medicomp Systems will be debuting a new module in its Quippe Clinical Solution suite that focuses on maximizing Medicare Advantage reimbursement with automated risk adjustment factor scoring and hierarchical condition category documentation.

"For providers participating in Medicare Advantage plans, the correct calculation of a patient's risk adjustment factor is essential to ensure accurate reimbursement," said Dr. Jay Anders, chief medical officer at Medicomp Systems.

"However, calculating risk and prospective cost of care is not only important for treating patients covered with Medicare Advantage plans, but rather for any provider participating in risk-bearing value-based payment programs," he said.
