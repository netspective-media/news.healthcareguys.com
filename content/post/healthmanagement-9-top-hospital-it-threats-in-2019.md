ECRI Institute has recently released its annual list of top healthcare technology threats that hospitals could face in 2019. Is dealing with these risks high on your list of priorities?

Hackers can take advantage of remote access to systems leading to disruption of healthcare operations.

Publicly accessible systems are easier for criminals to exploit to expose patient data and disrupt operations.

Action: Identify and keep strict surveillance over remote points of access points, and have a strict cyber security policy in place.

 

Sponges left inside a patient continue to be a surgical complication, in spite of manual counts.

Itâ€™s common practice to manually count surgical sponges following an operation but, still, there are errors with retained sponges.

Action: Consider technologies that supplement manual counting.
