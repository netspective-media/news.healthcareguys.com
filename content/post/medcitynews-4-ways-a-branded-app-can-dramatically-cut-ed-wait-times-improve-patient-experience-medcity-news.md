title: 4 ways a branded app can dramatically cut ED wait times, improve patient experience
  - MedCity News
---
Drive around any medium or large U.S. city, and you’re likely to see a local health system advertising its emergency department (ED) wait times like convenience stores advertise gas prices. But the confidence to advertise one’s wait times often doesn’t track with the reality that patients face when presenting in the ED.

According to the latest data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services from the 50 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia, 29 had ED wait times of 20 minutes or longer before being seen by a doctor. Total time spent in the ED exceeded two hours for 40 of the 52 areas. Long wait times aggravate patients and may cause some to leave without being seen or without receiving treatment, resulting in having an adverse impact on patient outcomes.

The question of whether wait times are increasing or decreasing is a matter of debate, depending on patient insurance status or geography. A 2018 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine reported that ED visits declined by 36 percent among commercially insured patients for low-acuity conditions during the 2008-2015 study period. Meanwhile, use of urgent care clinics surged 119 percent and retail clinics by 214 percent.
