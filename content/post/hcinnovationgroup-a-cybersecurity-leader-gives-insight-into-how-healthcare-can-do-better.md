title: A Cybersecurity Leader Gives Insight into How Healthcare Can Do Better
---
A report from cybersecurity software company Protenus last month revealed that the number of affected patient records—spanning across all disclosed health data breaches—has continued to climb each quarter in 2018—from 1.13 million in Q1 to 3.14 million in Q2 to 4.4 million in Q3.

But despite this continuous troubling trend, there still are indicators that healthcare organizations are simply not doing enough to defend themselves and stop preventable attacks. To this point, a recent survey from CHIME (the College of Healthcare Information Management Executives) revealed that about 70 percent of responding patient care organizations said they do not have a comprehensive security program in place. CHIME defines “comprehensive security program” as doing all of the following: reporting security deficiencies and security progress to the board; having a dedicated CISO (chief information security officer) and cybersecurity committee; providing security updates to the board at least annually; and having a board-level committee that provides security oversight.

Meanwhile, another cybersecurity report—this one from advisory firm Ernst & Young—found that while only 18 percent of healthcare companies are very confident that they would be able to detect a sophisticated attack on their organization, respondents did report they are willing to invest in better defense strategies: 66 percent of those surveyed plan to spend more on cybersecurity over the next 12 months.

The EY Global Information Security Survey 2018-19 did come to the core conclusion that cybersecurity—across various sectors—is continuing to rise up the board agenda, but organizations still need to take far more action. Healthcare Informatics recently spoke with Liz Mann, Ernst & Young’s U.S. cyber health leader, about some of the report’s healthcare-specific findings, how mature providers’ and payers’ cyber defense strategies are in this moment, and much more. Below are excerpts of that interview.
