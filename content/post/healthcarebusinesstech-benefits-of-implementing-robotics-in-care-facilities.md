A significant portion of a healthcare facility executive or decision maker’s responsibility is ensuring optimal patient care. While there’s no shortage of new technologies and services claiming to optimize a facility’s efficiency and the care it provides, not all of them live up to their hype. In this guest post, Dr. Eric Dusseux, CEO of a robotics company focused on providing rehabilitation and mobility solutions, will explain how as payment models shift to value-based, there’s a vital need for quality of care to be the new bottom line, particularly for facilities providing physical therapy.
