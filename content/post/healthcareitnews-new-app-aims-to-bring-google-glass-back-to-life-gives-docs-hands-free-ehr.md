title: New app aims to bring Google Glass back to life, gives docs hands-free EHR

Contrary to what some have said, “Google Glass is not dead,” according to EHR consultant Carl Osborne, creator of the app seeCOLe (short for, see Clinical data On Lens).

The seeCOLe app — worn with Google Glass or Vuzix Blade Smart Glasses — allows doctors to use voice commands to review and document patient information, hands-free. According to Osborne, “it integrates with FHIR APIs in real-time, with no middle man and no transcribing.” It works with any EHR, he added.
