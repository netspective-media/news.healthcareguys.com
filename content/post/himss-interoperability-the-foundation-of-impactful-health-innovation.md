Interoperability: the ultimate healthcare goal, the ultimate challenge, and the critical foundation needed to support impactful innovation of health and care. It is a highly complex topic with a variety of nuances – but when you break down the basics, it’s clear that in order to meet healthcare goals, connectivity is crucial.

“The current state of our healthcare ecosystem is more disconnected than connected,” said Mari Greenberger, director of informatics at HIMSS, citing facts and milestones in a special publication from The National Academy of Medicine.

“Healthcare technology has long been purchased in a one-off manner and often with uncoordinated approaches,” Greenberger continued. “This report highlighted that progress is stunted due to the lack of consistency around standard implementation, inconsistent purchasing strategies and diverging incentives for vendors across the healthcare continuum.” In this blog post, she outlines five key action priorities for healthcare organizations and systems leaders to prioritize in their interoperability procurement strategies.
