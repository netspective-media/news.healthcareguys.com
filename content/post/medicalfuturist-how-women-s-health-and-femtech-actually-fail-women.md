title: How Women's Health And Femtech Actually Fail Women
---
The majority of period tracker apps fail women. What’s more, fitness trackers and wearables fail pregnant women terribly. They were most probably designed and developed by men, and most likely not consulted by future users. We looked around at the women’s health and “femtech” market and found that digital health technology has yet to live up to female expectations. So far, the area is under-researched, underfunded and not understood.
