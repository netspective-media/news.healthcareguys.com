title: 'ONC: Hereâ€™s how hospitals are using EHR data beyond patient care'
---
New research shows that the ways hospitals tap into EHR information varies from vendor to vendor. Hospitals are continuing to surge in their adoption and use of EHRs, partially pushed by the 21st Century Cures Act. The records enable healthcare providers to more easily record and access information about a patient and, as the number of hospitals who make this data interoperable rises, providers can share the data with outside organizations as well. The fluidity and mobility of patient data speeds up and improves patient care and when it becomes portable it allows for a more seamless patient experience.
