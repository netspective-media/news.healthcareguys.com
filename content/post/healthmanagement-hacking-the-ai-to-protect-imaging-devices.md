title: Hacking the AI to protect imaging devices
---
Radiology and medical imaging is continuously experiencing rapid enhancements including quality of patient care as a result of uncovering new aspects of the vast potential of artificial intelligence implementation in clinical practice. As more hospital medical imaging equipment connects to the internet, cyberattacks and malicious software vulnerabilities present a clear and present danger.

Tom Mahler Ph.D. candidate and researcher at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (BGU) Cyber@BGU, and his team have been developing solutions using AI in a proactive approach to get ahead of any potential future threats. 

"In the current phase of our research, we focus on developing an anomaly detection system using advanced AI methods to train the system with actual commands recorded from actual equipment," said Tom Mahler. "Our solution monitors the outgoing commands from the device before they are executed, and will alert—and possibly halt—if it detects anomalies."
