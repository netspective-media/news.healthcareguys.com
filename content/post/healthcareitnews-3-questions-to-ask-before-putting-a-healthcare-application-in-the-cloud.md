And 5 tenants to understand once you’ve decided to move data into a private, public or hybrid cloud. Several years ago, many experts were indicating that by 2020 everything would be running in the cloud. The promises of economical on-demand computing and storage resources were appealing. Companies could look to reduce capital investments and begin to sunset expensive data centers by quickly spinning up cloud technology. Speed to market, costs savings, optimized processing environments, elasticity, agility — the hype was real.  Organizations began to adopt Cloud First strategies. Cloud articles were dominating the headlines and cloud vendors were investing big time and pushing for traction and momentum.

Fast forward to 2019.  While there have been cloud success stories and the marketplace is full of cloud services and solutions, the full promise of the cloud has not yet been fully realized – particularly in healthcare.

Yet there are adoption opportunities you can begin to leverage immediately.

Most healthcare organizations have private cloud capabilities.  These typically run in their own data centers and support mission critical applications. More and more of these private cloud environments are run on hyperconverged technologies that offer some unique opportunities to streamline operations and tightly integrate compute, storage and backup in one platform.
