title: More consumers are using digital health to manage complex health conditions,
  Rock Health says
---
As the adoption of digital health continues to climb among consumers, how customers are using that technology is evolving. Instead of a narrow focus on general health and fitness, users are starting to employ digital health to manage complex conditions, according to a recent Rock Health study. 

“Consumers continue to go digital and are now doing so not just out of curiosity or for general fitness and well-being — but with the intention to address concrete health needs,” authors of the report wrote. “More Americans use digital health to manage diagnoses, connect with providers, and make critical healthcare decisions, than ever before.”
