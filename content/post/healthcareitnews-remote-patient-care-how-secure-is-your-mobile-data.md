We hear a lot about cybersecurity breaches in the news, but we’re not always told the cause. The business or organization involved is rarely forthcoming with insight about breach scope and exposure. Companies only share details when the have to—when a customer or patient needs to be notified of payment card or protected health information exposure. We don’t learn the cause, source or nature of the attack, and we can’t always know if the breach occurred at the network level or at the delivery edge of the business on mobile devices. A lot of attention is focused on network access security; it can be easy to overlook the vulnerability of data at the edge.
