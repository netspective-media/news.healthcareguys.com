The Color Atlas and Synopsis of Family Medicine is now available in app form for Android and Apple users. The third edition of this reference text includes over 2.400 full-color photographs to aid family medicine practitioners and students. It depicts the most common diseases seen in practice, with photographs showcasing classic and unusual presentations. The images are accompanied by up-to-date evidence-based treatment recommendations. Each case is introduced with a Patient Story that sets the scene and enables better retention of facts. Following this introduction, information is presented in a bulleted format and broken down by the path a physician would mindfully follow: epidemiology, etiology and pathophysiology, diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and management. The reference text includes adult conditions, as well as pediatrics, womenâ€™s health, physical and sexual abuse, and substance abuse. New to this edition are chapters on the opioid crisis, mental health, LGBT-specific health issues, Zika, Ebola, and sports-related head injury. The text can be viewed offline after download and can be navigated through the table of contents or the quick search tool. Users can customize their app with notes and bookmark on chapters, images, and tables. The Color Atlas & Synopsis of Family Medicine, 3/E is available for download on Google Play and the Apple App Store for $129.99.
