title: Trump administration finalizes Medicare Advantage telehealth benefit policy
---
Medicare Advantage (MA) plans will be able to add additional telehealth benefits starting in plan year 2020 under a final rule announced by the Trump Administration on Friday afternoon. Under the new policy, patients on MA plans would be able to have the option to receive health care services from places like their homes, rather than requiring them to go to a healthcare facility.
