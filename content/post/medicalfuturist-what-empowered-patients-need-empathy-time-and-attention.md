title: 'What Empowered Patients Need: Empathy, Time, And Attention'
---
We strongly believe that only digital health can bring healthcare into the 21st century and make patients the point-of-care. Empathy, time, and attention are what opinion leader e-patients need most from their physicians, and that’s the most important outcome they get from an equal-level patient-doctor relationship. Cooperation between technology and healthcare is not enough on its own: the most decisive factor is the return of the human touch and reciprocal communication. That’s the main finding of the latest study of The Medical Futurist Institute, entitled Opinion leader empowered patients about the era of digital health: a qualitative study, published in the British Medical Journal.
