title: 5 Ways Telehealth Is Taking Modern Healthcare to the Next Level
---
When he invented the telephone, Alexander Graham Bell’s first words to his assistant were: “Come here, Mr. Watson, I must see you.” Legend has it that the reason Bell called his assistant over was because the inventor had spilled acid on his pants and required medical attention; if so, it’s one of the first known examples of telehealth.

Most people became aware of telehealth in the 1980s. Since then, telehealth has grown to encompass a wide range of devices and technologies that can transmit medical information in real time around the globe, allowing medical professionals to provide services to communities previously underserved. Further, it’s being used more often for both public and private health providers alike, including for the treatment of mental illnesses such as depression, saving lives in an emergency, and improving long-term health outcomes after a stroke.
