title: Interview With Robert Scoble, Virtual Reality Expert
---
Imagine that a doctor sits down in Starbucks, places some glasses on his head, instantly invokes five screens and starts doing his diagnostic work. Robert Scoble, virtual reality expert, and tech evangelist believes that will be possible in the coming years – sooner than we might think. He told us why his wife can’t stand immersive environments, when the first VR hardware and software with real customer experience will come out and when we will all know that a new world has come.
