Last week, the federal HHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) gave the greenlight to allow a virtual care company and pharmaceutical manufacturer to loan patients free smartphones, so the patients (which include Medicare beneficiaries) could use the smartphones to track their drug therapy adherence via a mobile digital health app. The OIGâ€™s recent Advisory Opinion marks the sixth favorable telemedicine/digital health advisory opinion issued by OIG to date.
