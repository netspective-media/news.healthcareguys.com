title: The Four Biggest Cyber Risks of 2019
---
They say “the past is prologue,” a sentiment that certainly applies to the biggest cybersecurity risks for 2019, which have their roots in what we’ve witnessed throughout much of this year.

First, some context: So far in 2018, more than 100 cyber breaches have occurred at institutions that everyday people rely on to help keep their lives in order. The most glaring incidents have ravaged companies in a diverse range of industries, including Amazon, Marriott International, HSBC, Macy’s and Nordstrom, Facebook and Instagram, as well as the bestselling online video game Fortnite. 

Many more cyber hacks and accidents occurred at lesser-known entities more comparable in size to the majority of independent registered inestment advisory and broker/dealer firms.
