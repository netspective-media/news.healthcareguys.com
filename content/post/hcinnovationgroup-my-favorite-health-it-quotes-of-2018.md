title: My Favorite Health IT Quotes of 2018
---
Covering the healthcare informatics beat can be challenging, but it has its perks, one of which is the opportunity to interview genuinely impressive clinical and business leaders who are working to solve some of the thorniest issues in healthcare.

Jonathan Baran, Healthfinch CEO: “When we started, it was a foreign concept to have an app store for the EHRs. Now we have seen widespread adoption of this model across all the major EHRs.They now think about themselves as platforms and open marketplaces where people like us can build technology on top of APIs that allow us to integrate our technology into the workflow.”
Timothy Peck, M.D., formerly chief resident in the Emergency Department at Beth Israel Deaconess/Harvard, and co-founder of Call9: “We are spending money on hurting patients.” Peck was explaining that the two-thirds of transfers from nursing homes to emergency departments that are avoidable re
