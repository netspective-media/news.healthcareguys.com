title: Rock Health, Startup Health's Q1 numbers show expected slowdown in digital
  health investment
---
The first quarter of 2019 is behind us and both Rock Health and Startup Health have released their funding report for the quarter.

Both agree that funding for Q1 2019 is down relative to other recent years. But both see other reasons to be optimistic about digital health investment.

Rock Health tracked $986 million of investment across 61 digital health deals in the US, which is lower than both Q1 2018, when about twice that much was raised, and Q1 of 2016. Itâ€™s about on par with 2017.
