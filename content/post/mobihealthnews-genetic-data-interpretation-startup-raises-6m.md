Trained using data from patient cases, publications and genomics databases, Emedgene’s decision support engine can identify and highlight clinically relevant genetic variants for the provider. The platform is supported by a digital workbench that helps users unify, prioritize and share case data, and continuously employs machine learning and natural language processing to update its algorithm with relevant new findings. The tool will then apply its new logic to past cases automatically, allowing it to generate and surface new insights to the provider.
