title: New AI tool predicts breast cancer risk
---
Identifying women at risk for breast cancer is a critical component of effective early disease detection. Available models that use factors such as family history and genetics are inadequate in predicting an individual woman's likelihood of being diagnosed with the disease.

Researchers from two major institutions have developed a new tool with advanced artificial intelligence (AI) methods to predict a woman's future risk of breast cancer, according to a new study published in the journal Radiology.
