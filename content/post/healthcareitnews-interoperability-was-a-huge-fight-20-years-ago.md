title: Interoperability was 'a huge fight' 20 years ago

"It was a huge fight," Roche, who is a partner at Avanti iHealth, told HIMSS TV.

Thatâ€™s mostly because of so many competing standards. There were specifications for data exchange, and different specs for clinical coding systems and, to make it even harder, they were at various levels of maturity.

Today, "it is tremendously different because we have made certain standards freely available to the public. That makes it easy to use, easy to adopt."
