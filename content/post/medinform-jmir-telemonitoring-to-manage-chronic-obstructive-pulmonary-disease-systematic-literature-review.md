title: 'Telemonitoring to Manage Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: Systematic
  Literature Review'
---
This review found mixed results. 13 out of 29 (45%) articles stated that patient outcomes were improved overall with telemonitoring, while 11 of 29 (38%) indicated no improvement. Authors identified the following facilitators: reduced need for in-person visits, better disease management, and bolstered patient-provider relationship. Important barriers included low-quality data, increased workload for providers, and cost. Three studies found that remote monitoring enhanced the predictability of exacerbation.
