Payers are establishing innovative ways to provide better care and improve the overall patient experience, according to America’s Health Insurance Plans.

That’s why insurers are investing in patient portals, mobile apps, telehealth and other personalized tools, like those that focus on social determinants of health, says Cathryn Donaldson, director of communications at AHIP. The use of this technology improves care coordination, which leads to better outcomes and higher patient satisfaction.
