Your hospital’s nurses work hard. Along with doctors, they’re the front-line staff who are critical for effective care delivery and helping hospitals meet value-based care initiatives. And with facilities having trouble recruiting and retaining top-notch people, it’s more important than ever to make sure your nurses are happy and fulfilled.
