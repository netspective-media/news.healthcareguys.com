title: Big pharma hesitant to embrace cloud?
---
Security and the complexity of digital transformation are some of the factors giving pharmaceutical companies pause when deciding whether or not to embrace cloud technology.

In addition, the substantial investment big pharma has already made in on-premises solutions for data storage means some companies donâ€™t yet see the financial advantage in making the move to the cloud.

The life sciences industry in general tends to lag other industries in cloud adoption, according to Larry Ponemon, chairman and founder of the Ponemon Institute.
