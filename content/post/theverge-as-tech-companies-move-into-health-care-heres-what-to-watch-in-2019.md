title: As tech companies move into health care, heres what to watch in 2019
---
From Amazon and Apple opening clinics to Uber launching a medical transit program, technology giants spent 2018 moving into the health care space. Many of these initiatives are still in very early stages, but theyll continue to grow in 2019, and some of them may have an impact on Americans health care experiences as soon as this year.The moves make sense from a financial standpoint: in any country, the health care market is one of the biggest industries there is, bringing in more than $2.8 trillion annually in the US alone. As experts point out over and over, the American health care industry is also extremely inefficient, which means theres a lot of potential money to be made. Finally, the industry is enormous and has many sectors, giving the big companies plenty of space to maneuver without directly competing with each otherâ€¦ yet.Heres what well be watching out for at the intersection of technology companies and health care in 2019.
