  survey'

Artificial intelligence gets a lot of buzz as a leading-edge technology in healthcare. But it still has a long way to go when it comes to adoption, with only 20% of physicians saying AI has changed the way they practice medicine, according to a recent survey.

In fact, the majority of physicians are anxious or uncomfortable with AI, according to Medscape’s survey of 1,500 doctors across Europe, Latin America and the U.S. Physicians in the U.S. voiced the most skepticism (49%), while 35% of physicians in Europe said they are uncomfortable with AI and 30% of physicians in Latin America said the same.

Although the number of physicians who say AI has changed the way they practice medicine grew from last year’s survey, 15% to 20%, the results indicate that AI applications are still in their infancy and have not affected mainstream physician practice at scale.
