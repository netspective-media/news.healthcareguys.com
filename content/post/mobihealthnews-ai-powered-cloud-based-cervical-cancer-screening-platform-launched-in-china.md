China Maternal and Child Health Care Association and Wuhan University Landing AI Cytology Diagnostic Centre recently launched a cervical cancer screening AI cloud diagnostic platform. The platform can be accessed worldwide as of April 1, 2019 and women, especially those from countries along Belt and Road Initiative, will be able to benefit from a high-quality, low-cost cervical cancer screening services.

What’s it about

After 17 years of development, Wuhan University Landing AI Research Centre teamed up with multi-disciplinary experts who established a unique system that uses AI cytopathological* software and Landing's robotic hardware. Landing’s scanning platform is connected to a cloud platform and reports that are generated can be sent directly to mobile phones or could be remotely reviewed by cytologists before being issued.

What’s the trend

According to a journal article by Jiangli Di published in September 2017, China carries a heavy burden of cervical cancer, especially in rural areas. In China, although there was a steady incidence trend of 7.4/100,000 in rural areas from 2007 to 2009, the national incidence has increased by 200.0% from 2003 (3.8/100,000) to 2012 (11.4/100,000). The national mortality rate for cervical cancer has also increased incrementally, with an overall increase in that period of 116.7%.
