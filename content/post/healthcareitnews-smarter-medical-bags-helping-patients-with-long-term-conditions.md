11Health puts intelligence and sensors into medical bags attached to patients living with long-term conditions to remotely monitor those patients, says founder and CEO Michael Seres. Bridge Connector on Tuesday announced that it has secured $10 million in funding from Axioma Ventures, thereby bringing the total it has raised to date to $20 million, and it intends to use the money to advance interoperability.

HOW IT WORKS

The company said that its integration-platform-as-a-service “can connect disparate data sources with a ‘no-code’ platform” that also “enables workflow automation in business and clinical use cases and transparency and interoperability among providers, payers and patients.”
