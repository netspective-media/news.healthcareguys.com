Healthcare organizations continue to fall short with managing cybersecurity risks as measured by how well they are conforming with recognized best practices for security and privacy.

Health systems and hospitals have an average 46% conformance with the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF), which is unchanged from last year, according to Cynergistekâ€™s annual report on the state of healthcare cybersecurity.

NIST CSF is a voluntary framework, but it is an industry-recognized resource of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity-related risk.
