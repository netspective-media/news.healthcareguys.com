Singapore-headquartered health AI company ConnectedLife today announced their partnership with Singapore-based non-profit foundation Ocean Protocol to advance the diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's Disease with a safe method of sharing patient-generated data.

By combining IoT and deep-learning tech, ConnectedLife continuously collects motion data to objectively monitor motor symptoms of Parkinson's Disease patients. Through clinical trials with the National Neuroscience Institute in Singapore and other research partners in Germany and Turkey, the company gathers tens of thousands of minutes of free-living motion data from Parkinson's Disease patients.

The raw data is then processed continuously over time to develop a predictive model to objectively detect Parkinson's Disease motor symptoms. Ocean Protocol provides the technology for the patient-generated data to be shared in a privacy-preserving and secure manner via blockchain tech.
