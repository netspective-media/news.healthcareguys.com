title: 3 Ways to Manage the Cyber Risk Posed by Connected Medical Devices
---
Pacemakers, insulin pumps, wearable devices that track patient activity levels and pills containing ingestible sensors that track medication adherence are among the innovations that allow physicians to monitor patients remotely, promising more cost-effective care and improved outcomes.

But connected medical devices also raise concerns about patient privacy and cybersecurity. Connected devices gather vast amounts of patient data and create more points for connection, raising the risk of a security breach that can involve not just the data but also control of the device itself.

Companies manufacturing such devices should understand regulatory and litigation risks associated with them and regularly take steps to minimize those risks.

Meanwhile, providers making use of the technology for patient care should also be aware of the dangers and step in where possible to ensure patient privacy and device security. In the wake of a major cyber incident, a healthcare organization may face government investigations, both domestically (by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other federal and state regulatory agencies, such as the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general) and internationally (by foreign data privacy and consumer safety regulators). Moreover, breaches can draw unwanted media attention, customer demands and litigation â€” all of which require a careful and rapid response. Counsel must be prepared to simultaneously coordinate responses on all fronts.
