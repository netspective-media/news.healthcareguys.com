title: Leading healthcare groups want more time on interoperability rules
---
Echoing calls from other organizations like the Electronic Health Record Association (EHRA), about 20 healthcare and health IT organizations are calling federal healthcare policy leaders to grant a 30-day extension on the comment period for recent interoperability rules.

In a letter to National Coordinator Donald Rucker, M.D., head of the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT, and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma, the organizations noted that the proposed rules are “comprehensive, detailed and intertwined.” The comment period deadline for CMS and ONC interoperability rules is currently May 3.

The rules contain provisions with “far-reaching implications for virtually all stakeholders” in the healthcare system, with a wide range of “complex, technical, legal and administrative issues included in the rules,” the groups wrote.
