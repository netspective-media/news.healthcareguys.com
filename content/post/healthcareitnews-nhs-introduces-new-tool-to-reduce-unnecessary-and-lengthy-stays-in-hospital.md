title: NHS introduces new tool to reduce unnecessary and lengthy stays in hospital
---
Over 6,250 care homes have now registered to use the portal, according to NHS England. The NHS and local authorities in England are rolling out a new digital tool that has been proven to cut avoidable long stays in the hospital in a trial in Devon, Berkshire and the north last year.

The pilot was led by the North of England Commissioning Support Unit, which developed the portal with funding from NHS England.

Called the Capacity Tracker, it allows health and social care staff to access information about the number of beds available in local care homes on any device.
