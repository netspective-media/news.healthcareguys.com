title: Interoperability and Putting the Patient at the Center of the Discussion
---
Some believe that patients aren’t able to discern how and when to share their data. Data is then withheld, often with the best intentions, maybe because of interoperability issues, stewardship and privacy issues, or because of confusion about data sharing.

I have heard strong opinions declaring a patient's inability to make informed decisions around the use of their data. However, that same position often, and abruptly, reverses when they or a family member is sick. When healthcare is personal, access to information, coordination and communication become vital.

Each of us makes decisions every day: some we are fluent in and others we need to learn from, but all are our own to make.
