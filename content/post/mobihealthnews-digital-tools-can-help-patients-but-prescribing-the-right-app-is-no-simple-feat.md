title: Digital tools can help patients, but prescribing the right app is no simple
  feat

A staggering number of health apps are being released with each passing year, many of which could have a lasting impact on patients entering the health system with stress, anxiety or depression. That sheer volume of options comes at a cost, however, as many therapists and clinicians who are interested in recommending a digital tool or service to their patients simply don’t have the time to comb through the App Store for the perfect tool.

Tackling these issues is a core focus for Kaiser Permanente’s Project Chamai, an internal effort launched in 2016 that is looking to address the 25 percent of patients entering the system with subclinical behavioral health symptoms. Through interviews with 38 members and dozens of other clinicians and stakeholders, the Chamai team has spent the past couple of years developing an ecosystem of convenient mobile apps that a clinician can suggest to a patient as a supplement to their normal care.
