Consumers who own smart speakers, Amazon Alexa or Google Assistant, already use these devices for online searches to self-diagnose health symptoms or for minor first aid.

Now Mayo Clinic is looking to leverage its presence on voice assistants to be the go-to source for health information, exploring how voice technology could help patients adhere to postdischarge instructions or a diagnostic tool.

The Rochester, Minnesota-based health system—which first launched a first-aid voice application on Amazon Alexa devices in 2017—announced at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society's (HIMSS) annual conference and exhibition that it expanded that content to Google Assistant-enabled devices and an AI-powered voice chatbot.
