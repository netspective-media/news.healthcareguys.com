E-learning is widely considered a useful tool for specific training and continuing education of health professionals. Therefore, like traditional learning, this teaching approach needs continuous evaluation in order to validate its effectiveness and impact. New research from Portugal found that an e-learning Course on Breast Imaging for radiographers was helpful in improving their knowledge and skills in mammography. The study highlights the role of continuous education models in order to improve delivery of mammography services.

Continuing medical education has been highly recommended by international organisations in order to improve the performance and routine work of health professionals, including radiographers or radiologic technologists. With regard to breast imaging, the radiographer has a key role in performing mammographic examinations. Also, mammography is currently considered the best imaging technique for breast cancer screening and the most effective tool for early detection of this disease. Thus, education and training programmes are needed to help radiographers improve their professional competencies.
