Current efforts leveraging blockchain in healthcare are few and far between, with many still in the testing stages, according David Houlding, principal healthcare lead for Microsoft. Speaking on Monday at the HIMSS 2019 conference in Orlando, Fla., Houlding said the technology allows secure, targeted sharing of healthcare data where it makes business sense — adding that its best value, at present, is in reducing healthcare costs.

“If you say you’ve got a new use case for blockchain that will improve patient engagement, that’s nice; but the ones that are getting early traction are the ones that have a strong cost-reduction value proposition attached to them,” Houlding said.
