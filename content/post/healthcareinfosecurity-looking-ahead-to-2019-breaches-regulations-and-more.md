This scenario has been creeping closer to reality. The attacks against Ukraine's power grid in 2015 and 2016 were among the first and most notable examples of how a targeted cyberattack could disrupt critical infrastructure. Those attacks, blamed on a suspected Russian-linked group nicknamed Sandworm, fortunately only resulted in a loss of power and not life. But industrial control systems remain a big concern for national governments. And there's a chance that even if attackers don't intend for their attack to have fatal consequences, fatalities result nonetheless. Fingers crossed (see: Power Grid Malware Platform Threatens Industrial Controls).
