title: 9 things physicians hate about medicine
---
You might have guessed it. Paperwork and administrative burdens is the number one issue that frustrates doctors, according to a new poll.

This year when Medical Economics polled its physician readers, it asked them “What’s ruining medicine for physicians?”

Some 44% said paperwork and administrative burdens, according to the publication (PDF). That’s typical. For instance, the American Academy of Family Physicians called reducing the administrative burden weighing down doctors the "most pressing priority" for its physicians and earlier this year adopted a host of principles aimed at correcting the problem.
