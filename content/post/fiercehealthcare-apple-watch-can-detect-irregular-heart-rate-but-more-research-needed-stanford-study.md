Data security is now one of the top aspects of healthcare technology. It can make or break patient satisfaction and institutional reputation. Healthcare providers have a professional obligation not only to care for their patients’ health but also to protect their patients’ data.

Cybercrime is on the rise against the sector because healthcare providers are often seen as easy targets with valuable information and insufficient security to protect it.

While several endpoint security tools can reduce data risk through detection and response methods, the most effective measures should be taken on the front line where staff members handle devices and sensitive information. Implementing a few simple best practices can significantly reduce risk.
