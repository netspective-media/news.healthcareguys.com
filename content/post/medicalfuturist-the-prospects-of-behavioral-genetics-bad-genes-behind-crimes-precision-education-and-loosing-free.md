Can the “warrior gene” explain aggressive and violent acts so that lawyers base their defenses on that in courts? Can genetics determine whether your marriage will be a long-lasting companionship? What about alcoholism, depression or autism? To what extent are we the product of our environment or the expression of our genes? While the nature versus nurture debate has been ongoing for centuries, the recent advances in genetics and genomics seem to shift the balance towards inheritance rather than the effect of our surroundings. We looked around whether it is justified, especially when it comes to its use in legal disputes.
