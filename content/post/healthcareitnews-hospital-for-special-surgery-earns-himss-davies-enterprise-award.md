---
The orthopedic specialty hospital leveraged health information and technology to improve processes and ultimately patient care outcomes. HIMSS has awarded New Yorkâ€™s Hospital for Special Surgery the 2018 HIMSS Davies Enterprise Award for its work improving its bed management process and average pathway length of stay adherence.

Many healthcare organizations wrestle with challenges related to patient volume on a regular basis. Seeking revamped strategies to address these challenges, the Hospital for Special Surgery focused on ways to improve clinical pathway management and their bed planning process.
