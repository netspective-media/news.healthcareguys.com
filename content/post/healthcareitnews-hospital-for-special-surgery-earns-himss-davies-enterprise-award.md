The orthopedic specialty hospital leveraged health information and technology to improve processes and ultimately patient care outcomes. HIMSS has awarded New Yorkâ€™s Hospital for Special Surgery the 2018 HIMSS Davies Enterprise Award for its work improving its bed management process and average pathway length of stay adherence.
