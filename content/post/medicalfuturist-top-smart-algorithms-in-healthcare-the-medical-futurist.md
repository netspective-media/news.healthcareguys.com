title: Top Smart Algorithms In Healthcare - The Medical Futurist
---
As artificial intelligence tools have been invading more or less every area of healthcare, we made a list to keep track of the top smart algorithms aiming for better diagnostics, more sophisticated patient care or further sighted predictions of diseases.

Does A.I. beat doctors?
Only if you lived under a rock for the last couple of years, could you not have heard about artificial intelligence. Some might have even come across the spread and potential of A.I. in healthcare. Not only smart algorithms themselves but also the hype around A.I. has grown immensely, thus every time a new study about deep learning or machine learning in diagnostics, in medical imaging or any other medical field gets published, newsreaders can be sure that some titles will say that “A.I. has again beat doctors in field X”.
