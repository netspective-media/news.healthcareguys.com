title: 'Use of digital health activity trackers linked to better medication adherence:
  study'

Medication adherence among those with chronic conditions is an ongoing challenge. But a recent study found that patients with diabetes and hypertension who use digital health activity trackers such as Fitbit or Apple Watch are more likely to take their medications as prescribed.

Evidation Health, a health and measurement company, analyzed Humana claims and activity data from 8,500 individuals. Those who tracked activity through wearables and connected apps by Apple, Fitbit, Garmin, and Jawbone were 1.3 times more likely to adhere to their medication regime for chronic conditions, according to the study, which was published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research.

“It’s encouraging to see this strong relationship between activity tracking and medication adherence as the health care system seeks to improve health outcomes and lower costs,” principal investigator Jessie Juusola, Ph.D., Evidation’s senior director of health outcomes research, said in a press release about the study. “This signals that everyday behavior data from activity tracking may be a useful tool for identifying individuals who could benefit from medication adherence programs.”
