title: NIH gives first look at All of Us precision medicine research health database
---
When the National Institutes of Health announced the All of Us initiative in 2015, it kicked off the largest health and medical research program on precision medicine with the goal of collecting health data on 1 million people. 

To date, more than 192,000 people have enrolled, including more than 143,000 participants who have completed all of the initial steps of the program. The NIH announced on Monday the beta release of its interactive data browser to provide a preview of the data that study participants are sharing for health research.

NIH is making the online database available to enable participants, researchers and other members of the public to learn more about the All of Us participant community and explore summary data, NIH officials said. Later, researchers will be able to request access to the data for use in a wide range of studies that may lead to more customized ways to prevent and treat disease.
