Although patient generated health data (PGHD) has stimulated excitement about its potential to increase patient engagement and to offer clinicians new insights into patient health status, we know little about these efforts at scale and whether they align with patient preferences. This study sought to characterize provider-led PGHD approaches, assess whether they aligned with patient preferences, and identify challenges to scale and impact.
