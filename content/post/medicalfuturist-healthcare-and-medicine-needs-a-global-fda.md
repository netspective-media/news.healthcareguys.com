---
Globalization reached healthcare big time: a French patient can easily ask a Belgian company to sequence the DNA of his tumor tissue, then convince a Swiss pharma company to sign them up for a relevant clinical trial on a Spanish island. Not only that but also the recent controversies around gene editing in babies in China, as well as the operation of direct-to-consumer genetic testing companies, the online medication scene, health technology companies expanding their services to other countries highlight the need for a global FDA day by day.
