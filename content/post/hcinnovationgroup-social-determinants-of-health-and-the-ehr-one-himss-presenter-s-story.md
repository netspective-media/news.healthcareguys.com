title: 'Social Determinants of Health and the EHR: One HIMSS Presenter’s Story'
---
The journey around the electronic health record is inevitably complex and challenging or any U.S. patient care organization. What’s more, every provider organization is navigating its own operational landscape. In the case of the Bronx, New York-based SBH Health System, incorporating data on the social determinants of health (SDH) has become increasingly important. That topic will be addressed by the organization’s vice president and CIO, Jitendra Barmecha, M.D., in a presentation at HIMSS19 on Tuesday at 2:00 PM local time, in the Allscripts Theater, Booth 3501, entitled “EHR Journey: Transforming Care in the Underserved Community.”

As the session’s description notes, “With limited investments (speed to value), learn how a community health system rolled out the Sunrise™ EHR from ambulatory care into ED and acute care as well as expanded its use to help drive outcomes. The presentation will also cover how we built and refined the EHR especially for mental health and substance use orders service lines and how we have leveraged our IT governance to manage on-going optimization and transformation of EHR usage to provide safer and value-based care in the community.”
