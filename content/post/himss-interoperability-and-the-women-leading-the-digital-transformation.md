title: Interoperability and the Women Leading the Digital Transformation
---
The healthcare marketplace is evolving from a business-to-business to a business-to-consumer model and research shows that these consumers are overwhelmingly female. As healthcare becomes more consumer driven and consumers demand interoperable solutions, it’s important to make sure women have a seat at the table when making strategic tech decisions about interoperability.

In order to meet this shifting market demand, organizations must reflect their constituents to better grasp the problems they are trying to solve. A recent study showed that publicly traded companies with “two-dimensional (2D) diversity” – with senior leaders who embody or embrace difference – are 45 percent more likely to report that their company has grown market share in the last year and 70 percent more likely to report that their company captured a new market in the past year.
