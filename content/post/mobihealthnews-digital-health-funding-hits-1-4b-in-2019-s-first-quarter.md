title: Digital health funding hits $1.4B in 2019's first quarter
---
Clover Health topped the charts with a round pegged at $500 million. Kicking off the year MobiHealthNews recorded $1.4 billion in Q1 funding spread out over 49 companies. This number exceeded the amount of last yearâ€™s Q1 funding, which came in at $1.2 billion.
 
Earlier this week Rock Health released its funding report for the quarter racking $986 million of investments across 61 deals in the US. Meanwhile Startup Health reported $2.8 billion in funding last quarter. The difference in numbers is attributed to the definitions of what counts as a digital health company, and whether or not international companies were tracked.
 
See below for a list of the funding announcements reported by MobiHealthNews this quarter.
