title: Telemedicine linked to more antibiotic prescriptions for children, study finds
---
Parents may like the convenience of direct-to-consumer telemedicine visits for their children, but a recent study found that telemedicine may be leading to the overprescribing of antibiotics to children with sniffles and sore throats.

Kids with colds, sinus infections and sore throats seen via telemedicine visits were more likely to be prescribed antibiotics compared to those seen via an in-person visit at a doctorâ€™s office or urgent care clinic, according to a study by Kristin Ray, M.D., of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and colleagues, which was published in Pediatrics.

At the same time, clinical guidelines for antibiotic prescriptions were less likely to be followed after telemedicine visits (59%), compared to urgent care (67%) or primary care visits (78%), the study found. Clinical guidelines are intended to prevent inappropriate use of antibiotics, such as to treat viral infections for which they are ineffective. Disregarding these clinical guidelines can lead to inappropriate antibiotic use, raising the risk of bacterial resistance to these drugs, according to the study.
