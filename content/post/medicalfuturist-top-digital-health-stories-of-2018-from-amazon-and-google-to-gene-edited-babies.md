  Babies'

Instead of mind-boggling inventions, 2018 was the year when national governments, as well as healthcare regulators, started to embrace digital health technologies at scale. The year when Google, Amazon, Apple or Microsoft competed head-to-head for the biggest chunks on the healthcare market, and when the buzzword of the year award went to the blockchain. Here’s our guide to the top digital health stories from last year.
2018: Under the spell of cosmos and microcosmos
Every year, The Medical Futurist team sits down and collects the top stories of the past 12 months in healthcare. We put the novelties under the microscope, and carefully consider which technologies and/or scientific methods could prove to be a passing fling and which are here to stay for longer.

Looking at the scientific field in general and considering a much broader context, it is safe to say that 2018 was both the year of Mars and genetics/genomics: humanity has considerably widened its horizon regarding the infinite space and the microparticle level. In practice, that means, for example, that paleogeneticists discovered that a woman who died 90,000 years ago was parented by two different species of human. According to genome analysis of a bone found in Denisova Cave in the Altai Mountains of Russia, the woman was half Neanderthal, half Denisovan. But not only that finding was made possible by the incredible advancement of genetics and genomics. In March 2018, NASA announced their twin studies program revealed that time in space can actually change the expressions of certain genes. Upon returning from the cosmos, Scott Kelly’s DNA, especially the telomeres underwent some changes.

In connection with humanity’s other space adventures, on July 25, 2018, the Italian Space Agency announced researchers discovered an underground lake on Mars. Using a ground-penetrating radar, scientists uncovered a subglacial lake. Later on, the Mars camera HiRISE discovered several spots of eroded land that allowed for more direct access to the planet’s ice supply. What is more, NASA’s Mars rover Curiosity found an assortment of organic molecules on the red planet’s surface, an indication of the possibility of biological life forms on Mars. And according to the latest news, the space agency’s Insight robot landed on the red planet after a six-month journey on 28 November. Now, even if we are not sure yet whether we can travel to Mars within 15 years, we might have a broader frame to understand humanity’s aspirations and its achievements so far this year, so let’s look at what happened at the forefront of health innovation in the recent past.
