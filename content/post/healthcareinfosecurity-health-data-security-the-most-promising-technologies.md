Several technologies playing increasingly critical roles in mitigating the potential impact of security incidents in healthcare, say Ron Mehring, CISO at Texas Health Resources, and Axel Wirth of Symantec.

In an interview after their joint presentation at a preconference cybersecurity forum Monday at HIMSS19 in Orlando, Florida, Mehring notes: "The biggest technology stacks we've been implementing are around optimizing our analytics, which includes behavioral analytics, event management platforms [that are] tightly integrated into the process - making sure that people, process and technology are fully implemented in the response strategy. ...

"A lot of the time we focus on the detection and the reaction phases - the containment and eradication phases, which are extremely important. But we forget about all the preparation phase items, which is the inventory of items and all the other [steps] that require a deep analytical approach but need to be well-integrated into all the other phases so that quick resolution can happen in a very complex healthcare system."
